## About Me

- A programmer working in machine learning and deep learning now.
- Around 6 years experience of coding.
- Around 2 years experience about working as a software engineer and data scientist.
- A big fan of [NeoVim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim).
    - But I will suggest newbies to choose [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) ðŸ˜Š.
- A fan of [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org)
    - Because I think TensorFlow is more modular than [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) in many aspects actually. Though it's not easy to learn.

## Programming Language

- Python (of course, it's my daily work.)
- C/C++/CUDA
- Rust (still learning, if a language is more safe and maybe fast than C++, why not ?)
- Lua (still learning, to write a pretty neovim config.)
- Javascript (ever, but I think I forget most of it.)
